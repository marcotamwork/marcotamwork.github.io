Hi! My name's Marco and I'm a Cloud DevOps Engineer from Hong Kong. Previously I worked at Green Tomato, working with different local and global clients in the financial sector, to support and process the cloud transformation, and build cloud architecture in different projects.

Here is my blog, to show several cloud engineering solutions or DevOps solution, including IaC on Azure, AWS, and GCP, python function Lambda and workflow on GCP, build cicd pipeline etc.
