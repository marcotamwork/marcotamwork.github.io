## What I do

In my role as a Cloud Engineer, I am deeply engaged in crafting robust cloud architectures and implementing efficient DevOps practices. My journey in Cloud Engineering is driven by a passion for leveraging technology to optimize business operations and drive growth. Under the mentorship of Jam at Green Tomato, I've honed my expertise in designing scalable cloud solutions that align with strategic business objectives. Effective collaboration and communication with cross-functional teams are integral to my approach, ensuring seamless deployment and management of cloud infrastructures. I am dedicated to continuous learning and innovation, staying abreast of industry trends to deliver cutting-edge solutions that meet evolving business needs.

## Learn to be a better ITer

Recently, I earned the Azure Administrator Associate certification (AZ-104), showing my skills in managing Azure environments. Looking ahead, I'm eager to pursue certifications in Certified Kubernetes Administrator and either Azure or AWS professional solution architect for my next steps, aiming to broaden my skill set and stay at the forefront of industry trends.

## Target

As I continue to grow in my career, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills in cloud architecture, DevOps practices, and continuous improvement to a new team. I believe in the transformative potential of cloud technologies and am committed to delivering solutions that drive business growth and innovation.

## Meet Marco

Hello! I’m Marco, a passionate Cloud DevOps Engineer from Hong Kong. Alongside my professional pursuits, I’m a dedicated cat person with three adorable companions: BB, Chacha, and Makmak. They bring endless joy to my life. When I’m not working or spending time with my cats, I enjoy playing squash and am currently looking for a squash club to join. Staying active and connected with others is important to me, both personally and professionally.
